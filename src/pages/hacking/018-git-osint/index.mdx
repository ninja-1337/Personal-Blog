If a user has made a commit to a public repository on GitHub, then their email address is more than likely publicly accessible.<br/>


# How does this work?<br/>

GitHub uses the email address associated with a GitHub account to link commits and other activity to a GitHub profile. When a user makes commits to public repos their email address is usually published in the commit and becomes publicly accessible.

GitHub provides some instructions on how to prevent this from happening, but it seems that most GitHub users either don't know or don't care that their email address may be exposed.

#Locate a GitHub user profile

#Locate a non-forked repository

#Find a commit by the user


<br/>
Finding a GitHub user's email address is often as simple as looking at their recent events via the GitHub API.
