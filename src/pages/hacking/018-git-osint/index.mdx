If a user has made a commit to a public repository on GitHub, then their email address is more than likely publicly accessible.<br/>


# How does this work?<br/>

GitHub uses the email address associated with a GitHub account to link commits and other activity to a GitHub profile. When a user makes commits to public repos their email address is usually published in the commit and becomes publicly accessible.

GitHub provides some instructions on how to prevent this from happening, but it seems that most GitHub users either don't know or don't care that their email address may be exposed.

#Locate a GitHub user profile

#Locate a non-forked repository

#Find a commit by the user

Within the repository view you can see a "commits" link on the left hand side of the page.
The more commits there are, the more likely it is to find a commit by the user. In this case we see 17 commits.
All we need is to find a single commit by the target user to find their email address.
Click on the commits link to be taken to a commit history view.


When viewing the commit history your target is to find one or more commits created by the target GitHub user.

<br/>
Finding a GitHub user's email address is often as simple as looking at their recent events via the GitHub API.
