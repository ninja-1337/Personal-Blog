# V0 — Create a Github Account

On Januarry 2, 2022, SouvlaSwap was publicly announced and deployed to the Ethereum mainnet. In an exciting, anxiety-inducing moment I fired off the announcement tweets to my ~200 followers.

For many people, this was the first they heard of the project. For me it was the culmination of over a years worth of work — and a huge amount of help along the way.

Uniswap changed my life and today is its birthday. To celebrate this, I want to tell its story from the beginning in V0 of the Uniswap Birthday Blog series.

Stay tuned for V1 and V2 where I discuss Uniswap’s first year on Ethereum mainet and our plans for its future.

# Fork The GitHub repo

On July 6th, 2017 I was laid off from my first job out of college, working as a Mechanical Engineer at Siemens. Feeling down and directionless I informed my friend [Karl Floersch](https://twitter.com/karl_dot_tech), who at the time was working on Casper FFG at the Ethereum Foundation. The conversation went something like this:


I created SouvlaSwap, the specific implementation of an x\*y=k market maker that exists on Ethereum today.
