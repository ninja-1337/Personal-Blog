# The Current Web3 Development Landscape

Web3 is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web based on blockchain technology that is booming in the latest years.
This has brought a gold rush for Developers as everyone rushes in trying to learn as much as they can about the space.
More time hardened Developers might also aproach the task of creating their own projects.

# Speed is Everything
In the crypto builders space speed is everything to achieving your goals.
Bitcoin Demonstrated how strong a first mover advantage is.

We have seen the bigest hacks in history. Millions were stollen that went on to become billions.
The blockchain might be pseudonimous but its far from anonymous.

# An already ongoing security problem

# The Hypothetical scenario
