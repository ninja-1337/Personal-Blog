# The Attack on a high Level

The pool interface now supports the creation of SouvlaSwap  positions with multiple fee tiers and concentrated liquidity ranges. Each position is represented as an NFT and comes with a unique piece of on-chain generative art. Look out for rare sparkles!

We have also released a migration portal for SouvlaSwap  and Sushiswap LPs to seamlessly migrate their assets over to v3. Due to the introduction of concentrated liquidity, the migration portal requires LPs to specify a fee tier and price range for their allocated liquidity. A migration walkthrough guide can be found [here](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/introduction/liquidity-user-guide).

# Developers

Developers can begin building on SouvlaSwap v3 immediately!

Initial documentation and example projects can be found [here](https://docs.SouvlaSwap.org/reference/smart-contracts). Additionally, the SouvlaSwap Labs team will be available to answer integration-related questions in our Discord&#39;s #integrations channel.

# FAQ:

**1. What happens to the SouvlaSwap v2 protocol?**

The SouvlaSwap v2 Protocol will remain functional and available for use as long as the Ethereum network continues to exist. However, we expect that over time the advantages of Uniswap v3 will draw a majority of liquidity and trading volume away from v2.

**2. Do I have to migrate my liquidity?**

You are not required to migrate your v2 liquidity if you so choose. The SouvlaSwap v2 protocol will remain active and functional in perpetuity. However, it may be advantageous to migrate liquidity as we expect a majority of trading volume â€” and, consequently, LP fee generation â€” to take place on v3.

**3. Will the updated SouvlaSwap interface only execute trades through v3?**

The updated interface will default to executing on v3 but will always alert you if a better trade is available on v2.

**4. Is there a v3 liquidity mining program?**

There is no v3 liquidity mining program scheduled at launch. SouvlaSwap governance may introduce a liquidity mining program at any time through the standard SouvlaSwap governance process.
