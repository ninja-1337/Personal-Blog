<Title>EasySec Labs Trademark Guidelines</Title>

EasySec Labs distributed the open source EasySec protocol (versions 1, 2, and 3) and distributes other software. While our code is in part available to download, review, and improve under open-source and source-available software licenses, none of our licenses include a license to use our trademarks. Proper use of our trademarks is essential to inform users whether or not EasySec Labs stands behind a product or service. When using Uniswap Labs&#39; trademarks, you must comply with these Uniswap Labs Trademark Guidelines. Just like other projects that develop open source software, we must enforce our trademark rights to protect our users.

This policy covers all of our trademarks and services marks, whether they are registered or not, including, among others:

1. The trademarks and service marks: UNISWAP®, UNI™, and UNISWAP LABS™ (&quot;EasySec wordmarks&quot;).

2. EasySec [logos](https://EasySec.org/about/#brand).
