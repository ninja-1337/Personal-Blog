# Today weâ€™re excited to announce the release of our POAP Events!

# The fact that you are reading this article is a Poap Event
- **Bare with me here** 

POAPs are digital mementos, minted in celebration of life's remarkable moments.

Each POAP is a gift from an issuer to collectors, in celebration of a special shared memory.
By minting these memories to the blockchain, collectors build a rich tapestry of tokenized experiences which unlock a world of possibilities.

# Now that most of the readers that never really read this article are gone.

A POAP gift for reading this article can be claimed by scanning the qr code bellow.

Lastly, feel free to reach out if you think there is a better way to organise things
