Congratz You forked your own personal blog


For many people, this was the first they heard of the project. For me it was the culmination of over a years worth of work — and a huge amount of help along the way.

Uniswap changed my life and today is its birthday. To celebrate this, I want to tell its story from the beginning in V0 of the Uniswap Birthday Blog series.

Stay tuned for V1 and V2 where I discuss Uniswap’s first year on Ethereum mainet and our plans for its future.
